# PulseBrowse

An unopinionated web browser in making that wants to get rid of the tabs nonsense that has plagued web browsers.

## Features ( planned ) 

1. No tab-bar. This also means no clutter with small icons at the top where you can't figure out which tab is playing obscene songs that you want to close.

2. Multiple tabs per screen when you want to multitask.

3. A versatile tab management system  ( sounds good, under construction )
